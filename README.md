SwiftSpinner is an extra beautiful activity indicator with plain and bold style fitting iOS 8 design very well. It uses dynamic blur and translucency to overlay the current screen contents and display an activity indicator with text (or the so called “spinner”).

**Note:** SwiftSpinner is now **Swift 2.0** compatible.

I developed it for my Swift app called **Doodle Doodle** and wanted to share it with everyone. Check the app here: http://doodledoodle.io

This is how the activity looks like (from the demo app):

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the DemoApp directory first. That’ll run the demo program which shows you how the spinner looks like and what it can do. 

#### Code samples

The simple code to get `SwiftSpinner` running in your own app.

 * In case you installed SwiftSpinner via CocoaPods you need to import it (add this somewhere at the top of your source code file):

```swift
    import SwiftSpinner
```

 * When you want to show an animated activity (eg. rings are randomly rotating around):

```swift
     SwiftSpinner.show("Connecting to satellite...")
```

 * If you want to show a static activity indicator (eg. a message with two complete rings around it)

```swift
    SwiftSpinner.show("Failed to connect, waiting...", animated: false)
```

 * When you want to hide the activity:

```swift
    SwiftSpinner.hide()
```

In case you want to do something after the hiding animation completes you can provide a closure to the `hide()` method:

```swift
    SwiftSpinner.hide({
      //do stuff
    })
```


That's all. If you want to change the text of the current activity, just call `show(...)` again, this will animate the old text into the new text.
    
## Requirements

There aren’t any requirements per se. As long as you got `UIKit` imported the spinner takes care of everything else.

## Installation

`SwiftSpinner` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
    pod "SwiftSpinner"
```

In case you don’t want to use CocoaPods - just copy the file **SwiftSpinner/SwiftSpinner.swift** to your Xcode project.
