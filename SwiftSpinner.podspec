  	SwiftSpinner is an extra beautiful activity indicator with plain and bold style fitting iOS 8 design very well. It uses dynamic blur and translucency to overlay the current screen contents and display an activity indicator with text (or the so called “spinner”).

  	I developed it for my Swift app called **Doodle Doodle** (http://doodledoodle.io) and wanted to share it with everyone.
